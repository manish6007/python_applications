## Overview

This is a simple Python application that converts text written in Hindi into an MP3 audio file using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Tkinter library, providing an easy-to-use interface for text input and conversion.

## How it Works

The application provides the following features:

1. **Select Text File**: Click the "Select Text File" button to choose a text file with a ".txt" extension. The contents of the selected file will be displayed in the text entry widget.

2. **Input Text**: You can also directly input Hindi text in the text entry widget.

3. **Convert to MP3**: After providing the input text, click the "Convert to MP3" button to start the conversion process. You will be prompted to choose a destination path to save the converted MP3 file.

4. **Status Updates**: The status label will provide information about the selected file (if applicable) and any errors that may occur during the conversion process.

5. **Conversion Time**: The counter label will display the time taken for the conversion process.
